"""The doc gate: the docs covering a file are read in the session before the file is edited.

SessionStart  forgets what was read, except at startup: after a compaction or a resume the text is gone.
PostToolUse   remembers each doc the session read (the Read tool, or a shell reader on its path) or
              wrote; in warn mode, after an edit, names the docs it skipped, once per file.
PreToolUse    in enforce mode, refuses an Edit, MultiEdit, Write or NotebookEdit of a file whose covering
              docs (tools/knowledge/doc-links --for, or the Spec: header a new file carries) were not all read.
Framework mode adds the specification: reading a code file loads the briefs of its @req IDs from
aeion-framework, and the gate waits for them as it waits for a doc (knowledge/components/framework-mode.md).
Docs, knowledge/ and work/ are never gated. Exit 2 refuses; exit 0 allows."""
