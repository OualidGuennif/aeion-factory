# Round 01 — Scaffold: Fresh 2 + Vite + Hono under /api

**Brief:** [`../../01-scaffold.md`](../../01-scaffold.md). **Result:** done. 5 tests pass, the smoke test passes, and the factory checks are green.

## Plan (skill `plan`)
- **Files:**
  - `app/` from `@fresh/init`;
  - `app/api/app.ts` (Hono);
  - `app/routes/api/[...path].ts` (the mount);
  - `app/version.ts`;
  - the spec `knowledge/components/idea-board-api.md`.
- **Not done:** storage, real pages, Docker.

## Steps

1. **Versions.** I looked up the latest of everything, then checked what Fresh actually accepts.

   | Package | Latest | Used | Why |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | `@fresh/core`, `@fresh/init` | 2.3.3 | 2.3.3 | latest |
   | `@fresh/plugin-vite` | 1.1.2 | 1.1.2 | latest |
   | `preact` | 11.1.0 | **10.29.8** | Fresh 2.3.3 declares `npm:preact@^10.29.1`; two Preacts would break hooks |
   | `vite` | 8.3.5 | **7.3.7** | the plugin declares `npm:vite@^7.1.4` |
   | `@preact/signals` | 2.11.4 | 2.11.4 | latest |
   | `@hono/hono` | 4.13.14 | 4.13.14 | latest |
   | `@std/assert`, `@std/ulid` | 1.0.19, 1.0.0 | same | latest |

   Rule followed: the latest version that the framework's declared ranges allow.

2. **Scaffold.**
   ```bash
   printf 'n\nn\nn\n' | deno run -Ar jsr:@fresh/init@2.3.3 app
   ```
   - I removed the template's examples: `Counter`, `Button`, `api/[name]`, the `/api2` route and the logger.
   - In `deno.json` I added `"unstable": ["kv"]` and a `test` task.

3. **Spec first (skill `spec`).** I wrote `knowledge/components/idea-board-api.md` with the eight sections and linked it from `knowledge/components/index.md`. Every code file got a `Spec:` header.

4. **Tests first (skill `test`).** I wrote `app/api/app_test.ts` with 5 tests:
   - health;
   - JSON 404;
   - JSON 405;
   - bare 500;
   - "the API module does not import Fresh".

   Before the code existed, `deno test` failed (`Type checking failed`: no `app.ts`).

5. **Build.**
   - `createApi()` uses `basePath("/api")`, `notFound` and `onError`.
   - The catch-all route is one line: `api.fetch(ctx.req)`.
   - Result: `ok | 5 passed | 0 failed`.

6. **Smoke test on the production build.** I hit two problems on the way.
   - **`deno serve` ignores `PORT`.**
     - I started with `PORT=8123`, but the server listened on 8000.
     - My `curl localhost:8123` reached **another local service on this machine**. I only sent GETs and a POST to `/api/health`, and that service answered 404/405, so no harm was done.
     - **Lesson: check that a port is free before a smoke test.** Since then I check with `lsof -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN` and use 8200.
   - **The fix: `app/serve.ts`.**
     - It reads `PORT` (default 8000) and serves the build with `Deno.serve`.
     - A computed import specifier keeps `deno check` independent of the build output.
     - Writing it through a shell heredoc was refused by the parent's `guard-bash`: the text contains `Deno.env.get`, and the guard reads that as "prints an environment". The Write tool worked. Known and documented, so no FB.
   ```text
   $ PORT=8200 deno task start
   Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8200/
   $ curl -s localhost:8200/api/health        → {"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}
   $ curl localhost:8200/api/nope             → 404 {"error":"not_found"}
   $ curl -X POST localhost:8200/api/health   → 405
   $ curl localhost:8200/                     → <title>Idea Board</title> <h1>Idea Board</h1>
   ```

7. **Adapting the factory copy to the project.** This step is what the copy's own "Adapt Æion Factory to this project" task asks for.
   - I wrote the project paragraph and the app commands in `AGENTS.md`.
   - I replaced the factory's own tasks in `work/current.md` with this project's entry ([FB-003](../feedback_for_aeion/FB-003-copy-inherits-factory-state.md)).
   - I restarted `CHANGELOG.md` at `Unreleased`.

8. **Factory batteries in the copy.** Their output led to three findings.
   - `AGENTS.md` went over 120 lines (126), so `knowledge-check` and `repo-health` failed. I squeezed my additions back to exactly 120 ([FB-004](../feedback_for_aeion/FB-004-agents-md-at-cap.md)).
   - `repo-health` failed on `app/_fresh/*`, the git-ignored build output: the plain-folder walk does not read `.gitignore` ([FB-005](../feedback_for_aeion/FB-005-plain-walk-ignores-gitignore.md)). I removed `_fresh` before the checks.
   - After that: `knowledge-check` PASS, `doc-links` PASS (59 links), `repo-health` clean, hooks battery 0 failures.

9. **Committing the demo in the parent repository.**
   - The parent's `doc-links` failed on the copy's 5 `Spec:` headers ([FB-006](../feedback_for_aeion/FB-006-parent-doc-links-nested-project.md)). That blocked the commit.
   - **I fixed it in the base:** commit `2c2fb1d` on `develop`, with 3 tests, a doc line in `specs-first.md` and a CHANGELOG line.
   - I checked that the new tests fail without the fix (41/43) and pass with it (43/43).

## Result
```text
deno task check   → exit 0
deno task test    → ok | 5 passed | 0 failed
knowledge-check   → PASS · doc-links → PASS (59 links) · repo-health → clean (after rm -rf app/_fresh)
```
