# Round 03 — SSR page and progressive form

Date: 2026-10-28. All rounds authorized by the owner together.

## Plan and implementation

Plan: render recent ideas and a labelled HTML form, reuse domain validation, and add a small island enhancement without client routing. Red tests were observed before formInput/createHomeHandler existed. Handler tests cover empty/list states, native 303 redirect, retained values, linked errors and escaped script titles. Four Chrome viewport/theme checks passed (375/1440, light/dark); screenshots and browser.json are retained and the mobile light/desktop dark captures were visually inspected. Browser testing found rapid updates overwrote sibling form fields; functional state updates corrected it and enhanced creation then passed. Production smoke now disables redirect-following to observe the actual 303. CSS uses shared tokens, system themes and an explicit theme selector. No vote controls or filters yet.

## Validation

Acceptance commands were run from workspace/app; factory checks from workspace.
