# Round 05 — Tags filters and bounded search

Date: 2026-10-28. All rounds authorized by the owner together.

## Plan and implementation

Plan: atomically index tags and add shared tag/text query parsing, literal substring search and page filters. Red tests preceded the implementation. Search considers only the 500 newest ideas globally, including tag+text with vote sort; a 501-record test proves the cutoff. A KV proxy verifies tag-only reads use the tag index rather than scanning ideas. Tag/text combine with both sorts; malformed tags and long q are refused. Whitespace q clears the filter. Page tests prove escaped filter text and native vote redirects retain filters. Chrome passed four viewport/theme checks and island creation/voting; browser.json and captures are retained. Both production and Vite development smoke checks pass (development output is in ../05-dev/). No full-text engine, extra index or client routing.

## Validation

Acceptance commands were run from workspace/app; factory checks from workspace.
