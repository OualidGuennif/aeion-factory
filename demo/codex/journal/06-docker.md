# Round 06 — Docker runtime and persistent volume

Date: 2026-10-28. All rounds authorized by the owner together.

## Plan and implementation

Plan: build once from the official denoland/deno:2.9.8 image, freeze dependencies, run as deno, add a Deno healthcheck and named KV volume. Missing Compose config was observed failing before implementation. Docker acceptance output proves healthy status, a preserved idea after down/up, UID 1993 and health in 5.47 seconds after restart. A negative build with an isolated temporary dependency drift failed specifically because the lockfile was out of date; the actual app stayed unchanged. Native Deno audit found no known vulnerabilities; security-review.md records the separate manual review and limits. The exact image identity is retained. Test container, network and volume were removed; no registry push. FB-002 records a documentation-heredoc guard false positive; apply_patch was the safe workaround. The local runtime and all app/factory gates pass.

## Validation

Acceptance commands were run from workspace/app; factory checks from workspace.
