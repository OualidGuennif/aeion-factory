# Doc gate

## Intent

The references in the code decide what an agent reads before it edits. A file that names its spec
(`Spec: knowledge/<doc>.md`), or that a doc lists in its `sources`, is edited only after that doc was
read in the same session. The after-edit hint said "update the doc" once the edit was done; the gate
asks for the reading before it, when the doc can still shape the change.

## Data sources

| Source | What is read | Owner | Freshness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/knowledge/doc-links --for FILE` | the docs covering an existing file: its `Spec:` header and the docs naming it in `sources` (files, not folders) | knowledge/ and the code | each gated edit |
| a Write's `content` | `Spec: knowledge/<doc>.md` in its first 30 lines, for a file that does not exist yet | the agent | each Write |
| `<tmp>/claude-doc-read-<session>` | the docs this session read or wrote | this hook | each event |
| `.aeion/settings.json` `doc_gate` | `enforce` (default), `warn` or `off` ([framework mode](framework-mode.md)) | the owner | each event |
| the file's `@req` IDs, framework mode only | the requirements whose briefs must have loaded (`axiom:<ID>` in the read set) | the code; the aeion-framework service | each gated edit; each Read of the file loads them |

## Inputs

- **SessionStart** from a compaction, a resume or a clear (any source but `startup`): the read set and
  the warned set are forgotten, since the agent no longer holds the text it read. A startup keeps them:
  a new session already has its own empty set, and OpenCode sends a startup before every prompt.
- **PostToolUse Read** of a `.md` file inside the project: recorded as read, whatever the range.
- **PostToolUse Bash**: a `.md` path given to `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `less`, `more`, `bat` or `nl`
  is recorded, so a harness that reads through its shell (Codex) passes the gate the same way.
- **PostToolUse Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookEdit** of a `.md` file: recorded, the agent wrote it.
- **PreToolUse Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookEdit** (`apply_patch` through the adapter, once per path).

## Outputs

- `enforce`: exit 2 before the edit, naming each unread doc, how to read it, and the owner's switch:
  `tools/aeion-settings doc-gate warn|off`. The edit goes through once every covering doc is read.
  In framework mode it also names the `@req` IDs whose briefs have not loaded, and asks for the file
  to be read again: that read loads them ([framework mode](framework-mode.md)).
- `warn`: the edit goes through; after it, one line of context per file and session names the unread
  docs.
- `off`: silent.
- Never gated: a file outside the project, `knowledge/`, `work/`, any `.md` file, and a file no doc
  covers.
- `enforce` refuses when the coverage cannot be listed (`doc-links` missing, failing or slower than two
  seconds) or the session has no valid identifier: uncertain is no.

## Invariants

1. A covered file is never edited in `enforce` before each covering doc was read in this session.
2. A compaction or a resume the harness reports empties the read set, so the doc is read again.
3. Docs, `knowledge/` and `work/` are never gated, so writing the spec first is always possible.
4. `warn` and `off` never refuse.
5. Every harness can satisfy the gate: each reports its read tool or its shell to the adapter.

| Invariant | Test |
| --- | --- |
| 1, 3, 4 | `.claude/hooks/test_hooks.py` (`doc gate` cases) |
| 2 | `.claude/hooks/test_hooks.py` (`doc gate forgets at session start`) |
| 5 | `tools/agents/tests/test_hooks.py` (the gate through the adapter: Read, shell read, apply_patch) |

## Determinism

Deterministic for one set of docs and one session: the lookup is `doc-links --for`, which answers in
about a tenth of a second on this repository, inside the hook's three seconds; no index is kept.

## Acceptance checks

- In a Claude Code session, an Edit of `.claude/hooks/guard-bash.py` before reading its docs is
  refused with `knowledge/policies/security.md` named; after reading both docs it goes through.
- With `tools/aeion-settings doc-gate warn`, the same edit goes through with one line naming the docs.
- After `/compact`, the same edit is refused again until the docs are read again.

## Out of scope

- Shell writes (`sed -i`, a redirection): the gate covers the native edit tools, as after-edit does.
  It guides the agent; it is not a security boundary.
- Folder sources: `doc-links` gives coverage only for exact files, so a new file in a documented
  folder is gated only by the `Spec:` header it carries.
- Whether the doc was understood, or read whole: a range read counts, as bounded intake asks for ranges.
