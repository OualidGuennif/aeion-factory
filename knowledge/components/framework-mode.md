# Framework mode and the owner's settings

## Intent

Let a project use aeion-framework's AxiomSpec without making it anyone else's burden. Framework mode
is off by default; the owner turns it on by giving the API address of the service that holds the
project's spec. Agents then read the requirements from that service: on demand with
`tools/framework/axiom-api`, and automatically as briefs when they read code annotated with `@req`.
The same per-clone settings carry the doc gate's mode. Agents read the settings and never change them.
[ADR-002](../decisions/ADR-002-framework-optional.md) records why.

## Data sources

| Source | What is read | Owner | Freshness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.aeion/settings.json` (ignored local state, with or without git) | `doc_gate`, `framework` | the owner, through `tools/aeion-settings` | each read |
| `AEION_FRAMEWORK_URL` | an address overriding the file for one process tree (CI, a container, a sandbox) | whoever starts the process | each read |
| `AEION_FRAMEWORK_TOKEN` | a gateway token, sent as `Authorization: Bearer` over https or to this machine only; never stored, never printed | the owner's environment | each request |
| `{address}/health/ready` | `version` of the running aeion-framework service | the service | at connect; at session start, cached ten minutes in `.aeion/framework-health.json` |
| `{address}/v1/snapshots/{current or digest}/…` | `nodes/{id}`, `context`, `trace`, `gaps` (aeion-framework 1.1.9) | the service | each request; `current` is the one release a sandbox service serves |
| committed code | `@req` annotations: `@req A-001 B-002`, `@req: A-001`, `@req(A-001, B-002)`, every ID on the `@req` line | the project | each session start; each Read of the file |

## Inputs

- `tools/aeion-settings` with no argument shows the settings and where each comes from.
- `tools/aeion-settings doc-gate enforce|warn|off`.
- `tools/aeion-settings framework [URL]`: without a URL it asks on a terminal, and refuses (exit 2)
  without one. An address is an `http://` or `https://` URL with a host, no credentials, no query or
  fragment, at most 2,048 characters.
- `tools/aeion-settings framework off`.
- `tools/framework/axiom-api ready | node ID [--full] | context ID[,ID…] [--scope direct|change] |
  trace --path P|--symbol S|--id ID | gaps [--phase design|implementation]`, with `--snapshot DIGEST`
  (default `current`), and for the three paged reads `--budget BYTES` (4,096 to 32,768, default
  16,384), `--pages N` (1 to 4, default 1) and `--cursor C`.

## Outputs

- `doc_gate()` answers `enforce`, `warn` or `off`; `enforce` when absent. The [doc gate](doc-gate.md) reads it at each event.
- `framework()` answers the address and its source, or none: no address means framework mode is off.
- Connect saves the address only after `/health/ready` answers 200 with a `version` from 1.1 up to,
  not including, 2.0 (tested 1.1.9), then prints the Claude Code MCP command for `{address}/mcp/`
  without running it. Refusals, exit 1, nothing saved: an invalid address, an unreachable service, a
  non-200 answer, an unsupported or missing version.
- Session start prints one line: `doc gate: <mode>; framework: off | on → <address> (aeion-framework
  <version>, ready) | on → <address>, but <why>`, `on` naming the skill `framework`; and when the code
  carries `@req` IDs but no address is set, the hint to connect.
- The guards refuse an agent's write of `.aeion/settings.json` (Edit, Write, a redirection, a copy, an
  interpreter) and an agent's `tools/aeion-settings doc-gate|framework`; reading and showing stay open.
- `axiom-api` prints the service's JSON answer on stdout, exit 0. The paged reads follow `next_cursor`
  up to `--pages` and merge the pages (`items`, `omissions`); a page left over is named on stderr with
  the command that continues it. A problem document prints `CODE (status): detail` on stderr, exit 1;
  an unreachable service or an answer that is not JSON, exit 1; a 503 is retried once after its
  `Retry-After` (five seconds at most); bad arguments, exit 2; framework mode off, exit 3.
- Reading a code file that carries `@req` IDs adds their briefs to the agent's context, headed as
  requirement text that is data, not instructions: one line each (kind, status, title, statement,
  linked IDs, the places that implement or test it; the service's line breaks folded), at most eight IDs
  per read, under a two-and-a-half-second deadline. A served brief, or a definite `NOT_FOUND`, is
  recorded in the doc gate's read set as `axiom:<ID>`; an ID the service did not answer is not, and the
  doc gate keeps the file closed in `enforce` until a later read serves it.

## Invariants

1. A settings file that cannot be read, or holds an unknown gate, fails closed: the gate enforces,
   framework mode is off, and session start names the problem.
2. An address is saved only from a ready service in the supported range; unknown is never ready.
3. The token never reaches a file or the output, never travels in clear text off this machine (plain
   `http://` only to a loopback host), and never follows a redirect: a redirect is answered as a
   refusal, because urllib would copy the header to its target.
4. Only the owner changes a setting; the agent's guards refuse every write path they recognize.
5. CI never depends on framework mode.
6. With framework mode off, `axiom-api` sends nothing and no brief is fetched.
7. An answer bigger than the asked budget is never cut by the client; the service names what did not
   fit in `omissions`, and the client never prints more than `--pages` pages.
8. A brief that was not served never counts as read: an unreachable service closes the annotated
   file in `enforce`, and a `NOT_FOUND` ID never does, so a wrong annotation can be fixed.

## Determinism

The settings, the address check, the version range and the `@req` reading are plain functions of
their inputs. The network answers are bounded: three seconds for a probe, fifteen for a client read,
one and a half per brief within two and a half per file read.

## Acceptance checks

- `tools/aeion-settings` prints `doc gate: enforce` and `framework: off` on a fresh clone.
- In an agent session, `tools/aeion-settings doc-gate off` and an Edit of `.aeion/settings.json` are refused.
- `tools/aeion-settings framework http://127.0.0.1:1` is refused as unreachable, and nothing is saved.
- With aeion-framework 1.1.9 serving a release (Docker, or Python 3.14, on the owner's yes):
  `tools/framework/axiom-api node <ID>` and `context <ID>` answer; reading an annotated file shows its
  briefs; with the service stopped, editing that file is refused until the service answers again.

## Out of scope

- Storing the address in a committed file: committed `@req` annotations are the team's signal.
- Running or installing the aeion-framework service, or registering its MCP endpoint (connect prints
  the command; the owner runs it).
- Authentication: the service has none; a gateway in front of it owns that.
- Writing the specification: requirements change through the framework's own workflow; an agent that
  disagrees writes `axiom-proposals.md` (skill `framework`).
- Briefs for a service that serves several releases: they read `current`, which only a one-release
  (sandbox) service answers; `axiom-api --snapshot DIGEST` reads any release.
- `@req` IDs in a file that does not exist yet: the gate reads them from the file on disk.
