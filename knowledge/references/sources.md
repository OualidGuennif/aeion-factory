Æion Factory is an orchestration layer over other people's ideas and tools. Thank you.

## Tools and plugins

- **Anthropic, Claude Code and its official plugins** — `hookify` (hook rules from Markdown and from
  conversation corrections), `skill-creator` (skill drafting, evals, description optimization),
  `claude-security` (verified security scans of a codebase or a change), and the LSP plugin format.
  https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official · https://code.claude.com/docs
- **Addy Osmani, `agent-skills`** (MIT) — the skill anatomy (overview, when to use, process,
  rationalizations, red flags, verification) and the DEFINE → PLAN → BUILD → VERIFY → REVIEW → SHIP
  lifecycle that Æion Factory's skills follow. https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills ·
  "Own the Outer Loop" (2026).
- **Vectorize, Hindsight** (MIT) — agent memory with retain, recall and reflect.
  https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight
- **The language servers:** Microsoft TypeScript 7 (native `tsc --lsp`), Deno's built-in server,
  Eclipse JDT Language Server.
- **Superpowers** informs the focused debugging, planning, test, verification and review updates;
  **context-mode** informs bounded output and recovery without bundling its runtime.
- **Graphify** supplies native structural code/Markdown extraction; **Archify** supplies
  source-backed architecture views and browser/provenance gates. Reviewed revisions live in
  `tools/architecture/integrations.json`; attribution and notices are in [CREDITS](../../CREDITS.md).

## Research and practice

- Chroma, *Context Rot* (2025) — long inputs degrade every model measured.
- Gloaguen et al., context files and agent success (arXiv 2602.11988, 2026).
- Lulla et al., AGENTS.md and agent runtime (arXiv 2601.20404, 2026).
- Anthropic, *Effective context engineering for AI agents* (2025).
- Doc-to-code trace links with LLMs (arXiv 2506.16440, 2025).
- Microsoft Learn, the developer inner and outer loop.
- Cyrille Martraire, *Living Documentation*.
- OWASP cheat sheets: secrets management, database security.
- GitHub docs: security policies, CODEOWNERS.

Mistakes in how these ideas are combined here are ours, not theirs.

## Bounded skill maintenance sources

Native skill enrichment and the passive, versioned `skills/` pool use only ECC, Addy Osmani
agent-skills, Anthropic claude-plugins-official and knowledge-work-plugins. The pool catalog
records exact commits, copied resource hashes and nearest license files. CREDITS retains
attribution; plugin-specific restrictions override repository-level licenses. Ten proprietary
Claude Security definitions are metadata-only, not materialized for cross-host use.
No model, automatic agent-launch obligation or generic quality threshold is imported.

Three ECC resource lines have reviewed, rule-specific scanner annotation comments. Their
exact original file hashes, locations and reasoning are in tools/skills/annotations.json;
the catalog retains original and materialized hashes. Other findings and changed source
files are not suppressed, and the complete pool remains in SAST scope.
