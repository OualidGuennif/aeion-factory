Task state only. One entry per open task, newest first. At most 150 lines, 10 per entry.
Finished tasks are deleted: the commit message and knowledge/ keep what matters.

## Connector drift check across all harnesses — ACTIVE
- Owner decision: 2026-11-01, "avoid such problems for all connectors": a stale or hand-edited copy must fail a check, not a session. Same day: the prompt-defense baseline and the three passes ship in 1.8.3 too.
- State: `tools/agents/adapter-check` compares every vendored connector — shared adapter, context rule, Claude hooks, dsh, Pi and OpenCode plugins, and the five native registrations — with the factory copy by exact bytes, and checks each config's script references; `tools/factory-tests` runs it. `.claude/hooks/prompt-defense.py` flags an injected instruction, hidden characters or an encoded payload in a fetched result, once per session, through every harness. `knowledge/policies/security.md` holds the baseline; `knowledge/policies/engineering.md` the three passes. The desktop dsh profile's `aeion-factory` points at this repository, not a project copy.
- Next: restart the desktop app so it loads the released plugin; run `tools/agents/adapter-check --root <project>` in every adopted project and in its CI; a tag-pinned install path for the desktop profile is the next proposal (who: owner).
- Blocker: none.
- Evidence: CHANGELOG.md Unreleased; knowledge/policies/security.md; knowledge/policies/engineering.md; knowledge/operations/agent-compatibility.md

## Golden task set — MEASURING
- Owner decision: 2026-10-31, start the local evaluation harness, then approve the twelve candidate tasks proposed with it.
- State: twelve tasks in `tools/evals/tasks/`, six implementation and six process; one baseline is recorded (architecture-answer on pi, success, 0.9 minutes) and eleven still say "not run yet"; `report` renders one row.
- Next: one baseline per harness on the same fixed commit, then compare (who: owner; an agent prepares each run).
- Blocker: one harness measured, so no across-harness comparison is possible yet.
- Evidence: knowledge/operations/evals.md; tools/evals/tasks/architecture-answer/BASELINE.md

## demo/ Idea Board run 2 — WAITING-OWNER
- Owner decision: 2026-10-28, each harness builds the Idea Board in a git-less copy, journals each round and files feedback; 2026-10-29, the run 1 wrap-up plan and run 2 driven by one orchestrator session.
- State: run 1 done and archived for all five harnesses (demo/<h>/archive/run-01/, comparison in demo/README.md); its feedback fixed in the factory (c3f586f, fd288e9) or in the run 2 brief (e1f30ad); orchestrator brief in cfc92e1.
- Next: run 2 is planned for the week of 2026-11-02, not before; on the owner's go, a Claude Code session runs demo/start/orchestrator/START.md, one harness at a time (who: owner, then agent).
- Checked 2026-10-29: the four run 1 galleries load 14/14 previews from file:// in headless Chrome, viewer opens, pages and closes; OpenCode is `opencode2` 2.2.0.
- Blocker: none.
- Evidence: demo/README.md; demo/start/orchestrator/START.md; work/handovers/b5bf5c06-1101-47fa-a0b7-f0ca1ac15381.md

## Live Devin, Droid, Antigravity and Pi hook qualification — WAITING-OWNER
- Owner decision: 2026-10-27, support Devin, Droid and Antigravity; 2026-10-28, Pi 1.4.0; adapters use documented, not live-run, payloads.
- State: Devin merged in #12, Droid in #13, Antigravity in task/antigravity, Pi on develop; no live run of any yet.
- Next: run the qualification steps with Devin CLI, Droid, agy and Pi and record the result (who: owner).
- Blocker: neither CLI is in the agent's container.
- Evidence: knowledge/operations/agent-compatibility.md

## Native strict context admission — BLOCKED
- Owner decision: 2026-10-26, attempt native 300k qualification using paid OpenCode Go DeepSeek V4.1 Flash.
- State: primary HTTP denial, 278k-input accounting and over-budget tool continuation exercised in isolation; strict launch still refuses.
- Next: qualify a portable counter, auxiliary calls and the full durable handover/compaction cycle before enabling strict admission.
- Blocker: the experimental counter/profile is not shipped; provider framing and complete native lifecycle coverage remain unqualified.
- Evidence: knowledge/references/opencode-context-qualification.md; knowledge/operations/context-safety.md

## Adapt Æion Factory to this project — ACTIVE
- Owner decision: <date>, started from Æion Factory (knowledge/decisions/ADR-001).
- State: the structure is in place; AGENTS.md still describes Æion Factory, not the project.
- Next: write the project's paragraph and build commands in AGENTS.md; walk efficiency/ phases 1 to 7 (who: agent, with the owner's yes per phase).
- Blocker: none.
- Evidence: efficiency/00-EFFICIENCY.md
